NAME
    Pasteburn - Sharable, encrypted, ephemeral pastebin.

DESCRIPTION
    Pasteburn is a web application for encrypting and sharing secret
    content.

    Using a secret passphrase you provide, Pasteburn encrypts your message
    then provides a unique link for you to share. Whomever you share the
    link and passphrase with can then decrypt and read your message.

    Secrets can't be read without the passphrase and can't be restored once
    they're read or deleted.

    Secrets can only be decrypted one time and are deleted when decrypted.
    Secrets are automatically deleted if not viewed within 7 days.

    Pasteburn is built using the Dancer2 web framework
    <https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2> and Skeleton CSS boilerplate
    <https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton>.

CONFIGURATION
    An example configuration file, "config.ini.example", is provided in the
    project root directory.

    To set up the configuration file, copy the example into one of the
    following locations:

    "$ENV{HOME}/.config/pasteburn/config.ini"
    "/etc/pasteburn/config.ini"

    After creating the file, edit and update the values accordingly.

    NOTE: If the "$ENV{HOME}/.config/pasteburn/" directory exists,
    "config.ini" will be loaded from there regardless of a config file in
    "/etc/pasteburn/".
