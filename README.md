# Pasteburn

Sharable, encrypted, ephemeral pastebin.

## DESCRIPTION

Pasteburn is a web application for encrypting and sharing secret content.

Using a secret passphrase you provide, Pasteburn encrypts your message then provides a unique link for you to share. Whoever you share the link and passphrase with can then decrypt and read your message.

Secret messages can only be decrypted one time using the secret passphrase and are automatically deleted if not viewed within 7 days.

Pasteburn is written in Perl using the Dancer2 framework.
